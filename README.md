# Search for the Claude.ai app

I wanted to try MCP and used the repository [MCP-searxng](https://github.com/SecretiveShell/MCP-searxng) by [SecretiveShell](https://github.com/SecretiveShell) as a starting point.

Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/reuteras/mcp-search-searxng.git
cd mcp-search-searxng
uv sync
source .venv/bin/activate
mcp install src/mcp_search_searxng/server.py
```
